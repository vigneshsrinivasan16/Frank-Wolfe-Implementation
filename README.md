# Frank-Wolfe-Implementation

This repository contains the code to implement the Away-Step Frank Wolfe and Boosted Frank-Wolfe algorithms, which are used for solving a simple quadratic function and classification problem using logistic regression on the Gisette dataset. The implementation references several research papers as sources for the algorithm.
